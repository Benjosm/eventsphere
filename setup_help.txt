# Project Setup and Initialization

The project has been successfully set up for development and testing. Below are the steps performed:

## Steps Completed

1.  **Node.js Dependencies:**
    - `npm install` was run, which completed successfully. The frontend may not yet be set up, so no additional packages were installed.

2.  **Python Dependencies:**
    - The backend uses FastAPI, JWT authentication (`python-jose`), and Pytest.
    - The core dependencies were initially installed using:
      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user pytest python-dotenv uvicorn[standard] fastapi
      ```
    - The `httpx` package, required for FastAPI's `TestClient`, was installed:
      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user httpx
      ```
    - The `python-jose` package, required for JWT handling, was missing and has been installed:
      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user python-jose
      ```

3.  **Verification of Tests:**
    - The test file `backend/tests/test_auth.py` exists.
    - The tests were executed using `python3 -m pytest backend/tests/test_auth.py -v` after resolving all dependency issues.

## Current State

The environment is now ready for development. The backend Python dependencies are fully installed, and the test suite can be run.

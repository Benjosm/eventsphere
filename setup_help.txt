# Project Setup and Initialization

The project has been successfully set up for development and testing. Below are the steps performed:

## Steps Completed

1.  **Node.js Dependencies:**
    - `npm install` was run, which completed successfully. The frontend may not yet be set up, so no additional packages were installed.

2.  **Python Dependencies:**
    - Runtime dependencies were defined in `backend/requirements.txt`:
      ```
      fastapi>=0.68.0
      uvicorn>=0.15.0
      python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
      pydantic>=1.8.0
      python-dotenv>=0.19.0
      ```
    - Installed runtime dependencies using:
      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user -r backend/requirements.txt
      ```
    - Test dependencies (required to run tests):
      ```
      python3 -m pip install --user pytest httpx
      ```

3.  **Verification of Tests:**
    - The test file `backend/tests/test_auth.py` exists.
    - The tests were executed using `python3 -m pytest backend/tests/test_auth.py -v` after resolving all dependency issues.

## Current State

The environment is now ready for development. The backend Python dependencies are fully installed, and the test suite can be run.

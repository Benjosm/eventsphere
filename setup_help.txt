## Project Setup Progress and Issues

### Actions Taken:
1. **Initial State Check:**
    - Ran `ls -la`, confirming the absence of critical directories: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `data/`, and files: `pyproject.toml`.
    - Confirmed that only `README.md`, `package.json`, `project_plan.txt`, and `.gitignore` are present.

2. **Dependency Installation Attempt:**
    - `poetry install` failed because `pyproject.toml` is missing.
    - Tried to install `poetry` using `pip3 install poetry`. This succeeded and installed `poetry` to `/home/node/.local/bin/`.
    - Added `/home/node/.local/bin/` to the PATH (though this must be done in the same command session to be effective).

3. **Git Repository Analysis:**
    - `git status` shows the local branch is 4 commits behind `origin/main`, and `README.md` has been modified locally.
    - `git log` shows only a single "Initial commit", which is inconsistent with the status report.
    - This indicates a fundamental issue with the git repository's state in this Docker container.

### Critical Problems:
- The `pyproject.toml` file and the `backend/` directory are **missing**. This makes it impossible to install Python dependencies with Poetry.
- The `frontend/` directory is **missing**. This makes it impossible to install npm packages for the React application.
- The current state of the repository does not reflect the project structure described in the README.md.

### Conclusion:
The Docker container was not properly initialized with a complete clone of the repository. The required project files and directories are not present. The setup process cannot continue because the foundation of the project is missing. A new, complete clone of the repository is required to proceed.
